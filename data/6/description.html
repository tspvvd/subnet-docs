  <strong>Infinite Games</strong> is an open-source decentralized platform
  designed to incentivize the prediction of future events by rewarding
  contributors based on the accuracy and speed of their model's forecasts. The
  subnet currently focuses on binary future events listed on Polymarket and
  Azuro.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Binary Future Events Prediction:</strong> Focuses on predicting
    binary future events listed on Polymarket and Azuro.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accuracy and Speed Reward:</strong> Rewards contributors based on
    the accuracy and speed of their model's forecasts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>LLMs open new predictive capabilities</h2>
<p>
  Making predictions is a hard task that requires cross-domain knowledge and
  intuition. It is often limited in explanatory reasoning and domain-specific
  (the expert in predicting election results will differ from the one predicting
  the progress in rocket-engine technology) ([1]). At the same time it is
  fundamental to human society, from geopolitics to economics. LLMs approach or
  surpass human forecasting abilities. They near on average the crowd prediction
  on prediction market events ([1]), and surpass humans in predicting
  neuroscience results ([2]). They are also shown to be calibrated with their
  predictions i.e confident when right. Through their generalization
  capabilities and unbounded information processing, LLMs have the potential to
  automate the prediction process or complement humans.
</p>

<h2>Real-world applications</h2>
<p>
  The value of the subnet first relies in the improvement of the efficiency of
  prediction markets. This value can be extracted by validators through
  arbitrage. The validators may obtain a better knowledge of the probability of
  an event settling and communicate this information to a prediction market by
  opening a position. The first applications built on top of our subnet could be
  related to prediction markets. A trader could query our market to obtain the
  most up to date and relevant predictions to their portfolio based on the
  current news landscape (LLMs would be constantly aggregating the most up to
  date and relevant news articles). They could then readjust their positions
  accordingly or trade directly on this information. In the long term, a
  validator could provide paid economic forecasts or more generally the output
  of any forward-looking task addressed to an LLM ([2]). A customer might then
  provide a series of paid sub-queries related to the information they aim at
  retrieving.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<div class="roadmap-phase">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Scoring with exponentially decreasing weights until settlement date and
      linear differentiation mechanism - July 25th
    </li>
    <li>
      Synthetic event generation with central resolution using ACLED data -
      early August
    </li>
    <li>
      Scoring with exponential differentiation mechanism, new entropy scoring
      component and new improvement rate scoring component - August/September
    </li>
    <li>Comprehensive and granular analytics - September</li>
    <li>Synthetic event generation from news data using an LLM - September</li>
    <li>
      Synthetic event generation with central resolution with various API
      modules: elections API, court rulings - data, space flights
    </li>
    <li>Mining competition in partnership with Crunch DAO</li>
    <li>
      Synthetic event generation with UMA resolution - human verifiers resolve
      our events through the OOv2
    </li>
    <li>
      Aggregation of miners' predictions - through simple cutoff for benchmark
      events
    </li>
    <li>
      Synthetic event generation with trustless resolution using UMA - we use
      the UMA Data Asserter framework for our event resolutions that then go
      through a challenge period
    </li>
    <li>More advanced aggregation mechanism based on sequential scoring</li>
    <li>Commit-reveal on the miners' predictions</li>
    <li>
      Make the prediction framework more LLM specific and create mechanisms that
      explicitly generate data for the fine-tuning of prediction focused LLMs
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider other prediction markets such as Metaculus and Manifold (mostly
      as benchmark events)
    </li>
    <li>Using Reuters or WSJ headlines for event generation</li>
  </ul>
