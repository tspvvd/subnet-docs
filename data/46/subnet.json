  "summary": "The goal of this subnet is to provide end users (game developers, virtual production, etc.) a way to populate 3D worlds by quickly generating high quality 3D assets based on text prompts via web app, API or plugins for game engines (e.g Unreal Engine & Unity), while simultaneously building a massive open-source library of 3D assets that can be used amongst other things, for further model training.",
