This is currently set to 1 TAO for every block mined.  Like other subnetworks, the root network consists of a set of validators that set weights (W). These weights are then processed by Yuma Consensus to determine an emission vector (E). The difference is that the vector E has a length equal to the number of active subnetworks currently running on the chain and each e_i in E is the emission proportion that subnet i receives every block. The root network also doubles as the network senate. This senate is the top 12 keys on this network which have been granted veto power on proposals submitted by the triumvirate.",
